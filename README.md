# CO_coordination

This repository is to coordinate the pull through and integration of Coastal Ocean model updates in Met Office operational forecasting and reanalysis systems.

The roles and responsibilities of the group are as follows:
   - Own a process by which demands for the systemâ€™s development can be defined (fixes for poor system performance, new science, limiting technical debt) and resource prioritisation for development agreed
   - Review the development and release timeline for new CO configurations/versions (and retirement timeline for older ones?)
   - Own and Review the integration (with coupled models and DA) and implementation timeline for CO configurations/versions being targeted by Weather and Climate Science
   - Review and monitor the evaluation process for new models
   - Ensure that the configuration information and evaluations are openly available
   - To include integration of CO configurations into the FOAM R&D suite together with its integration with coupled biogeochemical and waves components.

The group will:
   - organise a series of high level tickets to track the various issues and developments being integrated
   - plan out a timeline for specific CO versions to be implemented
   - meet every 3 months to discuss progress and review the list of issues

Current members of the group consist of the managers of the various groups responsible for model and data assimilation development, integration with waves and BGC, and implementation in forecasting and reanalysis systems:
   - Co-chairs: Ana Aguiar and Matt Martin
   - Members: Segolene Berthou, Susan Kay, Jonathan Tinker, Richard Renshaw, Jeff Polton, Hedong Liu, Breo Gomez, Andy Saulter, Mike Bell.
